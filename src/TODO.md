# Sybil Attack Countermeasures

- [ ] limiting the # of accounts that were started on similar dates that can
      rate a person
- [ ] normalizing people's scores like if a person rates everone perfect their
      perfect is worth less than someone who gives everyone one stars
- [ ] use a lot of account verification for making a new account
- [ ] having a trial period where others can rate you, but you can't rate
      others: based on time, rating, and number of "diverse" contracts
